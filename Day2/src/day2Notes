Concurrency & multithreading

Concurrency
Processes and Threads

Spawn new processes or threads
 process - new standalone application that you call from you main thread/application - it's something you spaw, when
the
  main application stops you want to shut down the process

 IPC - interprocess communication - how processes talk to each other

 Threads - like a splinter off the main application - start, stop, gets interrupted. Whoever starts the thread has total
  control over it.

//using Java 8 Runnable - see docs

Runnable vs Thread https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-runnable-vs-extend-thread-in-java/

Thread
For thread you have to extend Thread - limited because it can only use things that are derived from Threads

Runnable
for Runnable you have to implement Runnable. It is more general. Derives itself from Threads so you have to declare a
thread.

static method and variable means that it can't be changed
